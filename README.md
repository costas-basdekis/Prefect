# Prefect
City builder game, inspired by Caesar III mechanics

[Live Demo page](https://costas-basdekis.github.io/Prefect/)

This an attempt to reproduce Caesar III mechanics. Hopefully it will be possible to play a full game!

# Technical
This is build on React and Redux, purely with SVG, since it seems to be such a
nice declarative framework, and SVG is natural to use. So far it seems to make
things easy.

If you have any suggestions let me know.
